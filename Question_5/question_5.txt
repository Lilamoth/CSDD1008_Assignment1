Task 5: Setting up the JIRA Project (Sprint Creation)
------------------------------------

Sample Persona: 
----------------
Name: Raj Kumar Bhandari
Role: Site Inspector
Description: Raj has 12 years of experience as a Site inspector and Auditor.
He uses several standalone tools to schedule site visits, take notes and generate reports.
He is looking for a tool that would make his work easier by helping him easily document his
findings, attach multimedia files like photos and videos, set the reminders for any follow-ups,
and share the notes with his team. 

Scenarios and User Stories: 
----------------------------
1. As a Site Inspector, I want a tool like Evernote integrated with my auditing software so I
can take detailed notes during my inspections, attach pictures and videos and present my findings
in an organized manner.

2. As a Site Inspector, I want to use Evernote to manage my appointments and follow-ups, set
reminders, and keep track of the deadlines.

Project Backlogs:
-----------------

1. Research and prepare a initial framework to integrate Evernote with the Audit Software.
2. Design and create user interface for taking notes in Evernote from within the audit software.
3. Implement the functionality to create and edit Evernote notes.
4. Implement the functionality to attach multimedia files.
5. Integrate Evernote's calendar features for reminders and scheduling.
6. Conduct extensive testing to make sure that the software is bug free after integration.
7. Prepare documentation, manuals and training materials to teach users how to use the new features of the audit software.
